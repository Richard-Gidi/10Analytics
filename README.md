# Child Mortality Prediction Hackathon (Top 5 Finalist - 10ALytics)

## Project Summary
In this project, I participated in the 10ALytics Hackathon and secured a spot in the **Top 5 finalists**. The objective was to build a predictive model that can identify the likelihood of child mortality using real-world health and demographic data. 

This solution aims to support NGOs, government bodies, and health organizations in identifying high-risk children and deploying timely interventions.

## Business Problem

Despite global efforts, child mortality remains a serious issue in many developing countries. The challenge was:

- To develop a model that can predict whether a child is likely to die before the age of 5.
- To explore and understand the key risk factors (e.g., parental education, wealth index, breastfeeding status, etc.) influencing child mortality.
- To make this model accessible through an interactive web application for ease of use by stakeholders.

## Key Concepts Applied

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Handled missing values, analyzed data distribution, identified patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transformed categorical variables, selected relevant predictors, and encoded data.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressed imbalance in the target variable using **SMOTE**.
- **Model Building**: Trained and tested various classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like **F1-score**, **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **Recall** to evaluate performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Deployed the best-performing model using **Streamlit**, enabling interactive prediction inputs.

## Outcome

- Achieved strong predictive performance using ensemble methods.
- Built an interactive Streamlit application that allows stakeholders to predict child mortality based on input data.
- Recognized as a **Top 5 Finalist** out of many participants in the hackathon.

## Impact

The solution provides:
- A decision-support tool for policymakers and NGOs.
- Insights into key drivers of child mortality.
- A foundation for further development of public health data tools.
